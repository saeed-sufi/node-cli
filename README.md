* Regarding versioning: "Major.Minor.Patch". When there is non-breaking minimal change, use Patch to increment verisioning. When you added a feature which is non-breaking, use Minor and when you add a major feature which is breaking the current installations or if it has a lot of new features, then you need to add up Major.
